**Evening**

**Emmanuel, ... God with us.**
 
Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. -- The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. -- Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.
 
God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.
 
The first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, ... came Jesus and stood in the midst. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. After eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then saith [Jesus] to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. Thomas ... said, My Lord and my God. -- Unto us a Son is given: the mighty God.
