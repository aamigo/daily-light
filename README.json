      "Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. -- The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. -- Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.",
      "God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.",
      "The first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, ... came Jesus and stood in the midst. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. After eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then saith [Jesus] to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. Thomas ... said, My Lord and my God. -- Unto us a Son is given: the mighty God."

      "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.",
      "Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love. -- Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. -- Charity suffereth long, and is kind.",
      "In due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."
