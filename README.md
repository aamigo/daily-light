# Morning

**What God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?**
 
Who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? -- Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. -- For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them. Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
 
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit. -- The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those thing which are revealed belong unto us and to our children.  

**Deut 3:24; Psa 89:6,8; Psa 86:8; 2 Sam 7:21,22; 1 Cor 2:9,10; Deut 29:29**

# Evening

**He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.**
 
Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD.
 
I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ. -- I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. -- I have whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
 
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. -- My heart rejoiceth in the LORD. ... I rejoice in thy salvation.
 
Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.  

**1 Cor 1:31; Jer 9:23,24; Phl 3:8; Rom 1:16; Rom 15:17; Psa 73:25; 1 Sam 2:1; Psa 115:1**
