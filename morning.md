**Morning**

**What God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?**
 
Who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? -- Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. -- For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them. Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
 
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit. -- The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those thing which are revealed belong unto us and to our children.
